## User stories

### Payment User story
As a customer, when I make a payment in real life, I want a paper receipt of my transaction as today. It's needed for accounting service.
Exemple :
- You will buy your coffee with crypto in Starbucks soon,
- Today Starbucks gives you a paper receipt for your fiat payment,
- Paper receipt for the crypto payment with the transaction you can then QR code to check.

Smart contract can design forms of interactions between users: Marketplace (bid/ask), Auctions, Ticketing. These specific new kinds of transactions will need paper receipts to 
- details date, amount etc ...
- be tracked into existing accounting system for company or personal budget management.

For this point, we will take example of iExec Marketplace (computation ressources Marketplace) where a receipt of all the whole process can be printed, showing what the user has paid and what’s the workers’ reward for this off-chain computation. 


### Property Receipt User story

If you attach ERC721 to real object in life that have value : Art, gold bar, supply chain etc ... 
When you transfer the new ownership in real life by physically interactive with your client. The owner triggers the ERC721 transfer. This new previous owner gives the object and a receipt that shows the ERC721 transfer transaction.  
The new owner can check if the transaction is confirmed and if so, it can safely go away.
